        <font size="6">The trouble with Bears</font>
        <h2 class="sr-only">The trouble with Bears</h2>

        <p>By Evan Wild</p>

        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are
           proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for 
           food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, 
          like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.
        </p>

        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray 
          them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer 
          those questions, 
          and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small 
          bears. If you have seen a small bear, 
          then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) 
          from another species.</p>

        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large 
          and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in 
          the countryside. Different habitats encourange different behaviour 
          however, as you'll find out below. 
          The below table also gives you some useful facts about bears.

        <h3 class="sr-only">Habitats and Eating habits</h3>

        <p>Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other natually 
          growing ingredients. In general they will hunt for food themselves 
          in woodland or rivers, but at a push they will track down their 
          sustenance from farms or country houses. 
          They tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.</p>

        <p>Urban (gentrified) bears on the other hand have largely abandoned the 
          old ways. They will hunt other urban creatures if necessary 
          (including other predators like rats and foxes), but prefer to 
          scavenge from readily available urban food outlets like dumpsters, bins, and fast food joints.
          When food has proven scarce, urban bears have even been known to 
          break into people's kitchens and steal essentials like baked beans, 
          ready meals, and microwave ovens.</p>

          <p>Evan Wild is an unemployed plumber from Doncaster, who 
            has been really "in to" wildlife since childhood. He once 
            went to Chester Zoo on holiday, 
            but got ill after eating a doner kebab.</p>
            <p>He has never seen a bear, but once read a Daily Mail article 
              about them, 
              and thinks they sound cool.</p>

                <p>Oh I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys
                   in the woods. With their sniffing little noses and their bad 
                   attitudes, they can sure be a menace — I was thinking of putting
                    them all in a truck and driving them outta here. 
                  I run a zoo, you know.</p>
